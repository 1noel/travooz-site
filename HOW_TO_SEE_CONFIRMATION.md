## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### If you don't see the confirmation:

1. **Check Console** (F12)
   - Look for errors in the browser console
   - Check for "Booking response:" log

2. **Make sure you're logged in**
   - Booking requires authentication
   - Sign in first if you see "Please sign in" message

3. **Fill all required fields**
   - All fields with * must be filled
   - Driver age must be 21+
   - Drop-off date must be after pickup

4. **Check the file exists**
   - Confirm `src/components/BookingConfirmation.jsx` exists
   - Confirm no compilation errors
