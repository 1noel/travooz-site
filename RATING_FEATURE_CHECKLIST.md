## 🔌 Backend Requirements

### API Endpoints to Implement:

#### Hotel Ratings:

- [ ] POST `/api/v1/homestays/rate`

  - [ ] Accept: homestay_id, rating (1-5), comment (optional)
  - [ ] Return: success status, updated averageRating, totalReviews
  - [ ] Validate: user is authenticated
  - [ ] Validate: rating is 1-5
  - [ ] Store: user_id, homestay_id, rating, comment, timestamp

- [ ] GET `/api/v1/homestays/{id}/ratings`
  - [ ] Return: averageRating, totalReviews, ratings array
  - [ ] Include: user info for each rating
  - [ ] Sort: by date (newest first)

#### Restaurant Ratings:

- [ ] POST `/api/v1/eating-places/rate`

  - [ ] Accept: eating_place_id, rating (1-5), comment (optional)
  - [ ] Return: success status, updated averageRating, totalReviews
  - [ ] Validate: user is authenticated
  - [ ] Validate: rating is 1-5
  - [ ] Store: user_id, eating_place_id, rating, comment, timestamp

- [ ] GET `/api/v1/eating-places/{id}/ratings`
  - [ ] Return: averageRating, totalReviews, ratings array
  - [ ] Include: user info for each rating
  - [ ] Sort: by date (newest first)

### Database Tables:

#### homestay_ratings:

- [ ] id (primary key)
- [ ] homestay_id (foreign key)
- [ ] user_id (foreign key)
- [ ] rating (integer, 1-5)
- [ ] comment (text, nullable)
- [ ] created_at (timestamp)
- [ ] updated_at (timestamp)

#### eating_place_ratings:

- [ ] id (primary key)
- [ ] eating_place_id (foreign key)
- [ ] user_id (foreign key)
- [ ] rating (integer, 1-5)
- [ ] comment (text, nullable)
- [ ] created_at (timestamp)
- [ ] updated_at (timestamp)

### Business Logic:

- [ ] Calculate average rating dynamically
- [ ] Count total reviews
- [ ] Prevent duplicate ratings (one per user per property)
  - Or allow updates to existing ratings
- [ ] Validate user authentication
- [ ] Sanitize comment input (XSS prevention)
- [ ] Rate limiting (prevent spam)
