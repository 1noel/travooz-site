## 📊 Analytics Tracking (Recommended)

Track these events for insights:

- `rating_submitted` - User submits a rating
- `rating_cancelled` - User closes modal without submitting
- `rating_star_selected` - Track which stars are selected
- `review_comment_added` - User adds a comment
- `authentication_required` - User tries to rate without login

---

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

1. **No Edit/Delete** - Users cannot edit or delete submitted ratings
2. **No Review List** - Individual reviews not displayed yet
3. **No Pagination** - If many reviews, might need pagination
4. **No Moderation** - All reviews published immediately
5. **Static Breakdown** - Rating breakdown uses random data (needs backend)
6. **No Photos** - Cannot attach photos to reviews
7. **Single Rating** - Users can submit multiple ratings (might want to prevent)

## 🔧 Maintenance Notes

### Dependencies:

- React 19.1.1
- Axios (from config.js)

## 📝 Code Quality

### Best Practices:

✅ Proper error handling
✅ Loading states
✅ Form validation
✅ TypeScript-ready prop structure

  const handleRateClick = () => {
    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      alert("Please sign in");
      return;
    }
    setShowRatingModal(true);
  };

  const handleRatingSubmit = async (ratingData) => {
    // Submit rating to your API endpoint
    const response = await ratingsService.submitHomestayRating({
      homestayId: propertyId,
      rating: ratingData.rating,
      comment: ratingData.comment,
    });

    if (response.success) {
      // Update local state
      setRating((prev) => ({
        averageRating: response.data.averageRating,
        totalReviews: prev.totalReviews + 1,
      }));
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <RatingDisplay
        averageRating={rating.averageRating}
        totalReviews={rating.totalReviews}
        onRateClick={handleRateClick}
      />
