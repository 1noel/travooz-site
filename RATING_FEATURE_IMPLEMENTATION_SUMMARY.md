- Non-authenticated users see warning toast

### Flow:

    ↓
Check useAuth().isAuthenticated
    ↓
    ├─ NO  → showToast("warning", "Please sign in...")
    │         Modal does NOT open
    │
    └─ YES → setShowRatingModal(true)
               Modal opens
               User submits rating
```

---

## 📊 State Management

### Hotel Details Page:

```jsx
const [showRatingModal, setShowRatingModal] = useState(false);
const [hotelRating, setHotelRating] = useState({
  averageRating: 0,
  totalReviews: 0,
});
```
